stream and buffer 
stream -  sequence of data moved from one point to other.
buffer  - memory
200mb

SF ----> Read buffer --->readfile -------> writefile -----> write buffer -----> DF
         (chunk by chunk)

chunk -  data store in the memory ---> use it ---> free from memory 

efficient data processing

Types -
1. readable stream - from where we read data chunk by chunk 
2. writeable stream - to which we write data chunk by chunk
3. transform stream -  modify and transform data as it is read or write 
                        zlib, uppercase
4. duplex stream (read and write both at the same time) - web socket 


readable stream -  request stream , readfile 
                    events  -  data , end 
                    methods - read , pipe 

writeable -  response stream , writefile 
            events  -  drain , finish 
            method - write , end



single thread 
nodejs architecture 
event loop 
events            

custom event -> events module 

1. transform stream -
2. custom events 
3. nodejs internal architecture - event loop , libuv, v8 -> thread pool => HOW JS Works
